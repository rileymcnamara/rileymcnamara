### Computational Physicist  
### Modelling Complex Systems Through First Principles

I am a physics graduate specialising in computational modelling, numerical simulation, and theory driven software development.  
My work focuses on building mechanistic models that translate physical laws into interpretable and reproducible computational systems, with current applications in biomedical and biological growth modelling.

## Core Identity

**Physics first. Computation as the instrument. Data as constraint.**

I approach problems by  
• defining explicit assumptions  
• expressing them mathematically  
• implementing them computationally  
• validating them against experiment  

This philosophy guides both my research and software design.

## Research Philosophy

I value models that explain over models that merely predict.  
Performance is secondary to interpretability, robustness, and physical consistency.

Good code should read like an argument, not a trick.

## Collaboration

Open to collaboration in  
• computational physics  
• applied mathematical modelling  
• research software engineering  

If your work sits between theory, computation, and data, we will likely get along.
